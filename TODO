- Add subroutine to compute the max possible time step.

- Add implicit residual smoothing to accelerate convergence.

- Parallelize loops using OpenMP.

- Add subroutine which computes residual of NS.
  - Must add subroutine for computing the viscous fluxes.
    The viscous flux is shown in Eq. 2.23.  I have to
    evaluate the first derivatives of the velocity field
    and temperature.
  - Must compute gradient of u,v,T and gradient of each
    respective derivative so that the states can be
    reconstructed at the faces.
  - After I have the states at the faces, the viscous
    fluxes are computing using the averaged states at
    the faces.
  - If I can do all this, I'm done with the NS solver.

- Implement selective frequency damping.

- Use Frechet derivative to compute the eigenmodes and
  eigenvalues.
