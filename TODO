- Fix slip wall BC.
  - Slip wall is currently being enforced weakly
    by extrapolating the pressure from the cell
    centers to the walls.  This is not working.
    I need to set the state at the ghost cells,
    reconstruct the solution at the boundary
    faces and then solve the riemann problem to
    find the flux.
  - This can be accomplished by adding a method
    to compute the gradients along the boundaries.

- Add subroutine to compute the max possible time step.

- Create subroutine for computing gradients along
  the boundaries (including ghost cells).

- Add subroutine which computes residual of NS.
  - Must add subroutine for computing the viscous fluxes.
    The viscous flux is shown in Eq. 2.23.  I have to
    evaluate the first derivatives of the velocity field
    and temperature.
  - Must compute gradient of u,v,T and gradient of each
    respective derivative so that the states can be
    reconstructed at the faces.
  - After I have the states at the faces, the viscous
    fluxes are computing using the averaged states at
    the faces.
  - If I can do all this, I'm done with the NS solver.

- Add implicit residual smoothing to accelerate convergence.
