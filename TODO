- Implement generalized boundary conditions.
  - Create boundary condition class.
  - Derive specific BCs from base BC class.
  - Pass BCs to initialize

- Generalize residual so that different time.
  stepping methods can be added easily.
  - Rename update to inviscid_residual.
  - Remove Forward Euler update in update.

- Implement RK4.
  - Must generalize the residual first.
  - Should be pretty easy to add RK4 after that.

- Add minmod limiter.
  - Going to have to change how the interface
    states are reconstructed.  I believe I must
    reconstruct the interface states on an
    interface-by-interface basis, not on an
    element-by-element basis.

- Add namelist for inputs such as:
  - mesh
  - boundary conditions
  - freestream conditions
