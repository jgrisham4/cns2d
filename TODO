I now have the gradient calculation.  It seems to be correct.
Now, I believe that I should go through and reconstruct the
states on each face according to

u^L_{i,j+1/2} = u_{i,j} + (grad(u) . rvec) phi(r)

where r = (grad(u) . rvec)_L / (grad(u) . rvec)_R

This will construct the interface states which will
then be used to solve the Riemann problem using Roe's
approximate scheme.

After that, all I need to do is change the
update subroutine so that the fluxes from all the interfaces
are accounted for in the computation of the residual.  Then,
I need to implement boundary conditions.  I'm going to need
slip wall and farfield for now probably.  Then, the Euler
solver should be done.

Something is wrong... I'm getting negative densities after
the first step which is causing NaNs.  I need to double
check the conversions from primitive to conservative,
reconstruction and switch from the barth limiter to the
minmod limiter.  There is a good explanation of the minmod
limiter in Leveque's book.

It seems that the information is not being communicated from
the farfield boundaries.  The fluxes aren't changing, which
indicates that the boundary condition is being enforced,
and it seems that the reconstruction is working okay...
When I print out reconstructed values, they seem reasonable.
One idea is to hardwire the reconstruction for the cartesian
grid case being solved.  Then I might be able to figure out
if the reconstruction is what is causing the issue.

The sign on some of the fluxes was wrong.  Now, the farfield
boundaries seem wrong.  It is because I am changing the sign
of the fluxes in the final loop.  I need to change the enforcement
of the farfield boundary conditions so that they use the inward pointing face normal!!!!!
