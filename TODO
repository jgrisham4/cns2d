I now have the gradient calculation.  It seems to be correct.  
Now, I believe that I should go through and reconstruct the 
states on each face according to

u^L_{i,j+1/2} = u_{i,j} + (grad(u) . rvec) phi(r)

where r = (grad(u) . rvec)_L / (grad(u) . rvec)_R

This will construct the interface states which will 
then be used to solve the Riemann problem using Roe's
approximate scheme.  

After that, all I need to do is change the
update subroutine so that the fluxes from all the interfaces
are accounted for in the computation of the residual.  Then,
I need to implement boundary conditions.  I'm going to need
slip wall and farfield for now probably.  Then, the Euler 
solver should be done.
