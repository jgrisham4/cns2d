- Add tests for utils (find_elem_min and find_elem_max), etc.  This could
  be done relatively easily by creating a simple mesh, assigning a field
  over the mesh and calling the method to make sure it finds the proper
  max and min.

- Write unit tests for everything I can possibly
  think of.

- Check spatial order of accuracy of Euler solver using Ringleb flow.

- Parallelize loops using OpenMP.

- Implement selective frequency damping.

- Use Frechet derivative to compute the eigenmodes and
  eigenvalues.
