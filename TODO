- Implement Green-Gauss method for computing gradients at the faces.

- Add member to edge class for gradients of velocities and temperature at
  the midpoints.

- Modify viscous flux function so that it uses midpoint gradient.

- Add argument to residual_inv and residual_inv_fo which controls whether or not
  the residual is actually computed for the Navier-Stokes solution.  This could
  save some time by avoiding this loop over all elements at each timestep.

- Write unit tests for everything I can possibly
  think of.

- Parallelize loops using OpenMP.

- Implement selective frequency damping.

- Use Frechet derivative to compute the eigenmodes and
  eigenvalues.
