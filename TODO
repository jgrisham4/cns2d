Just finished the gradient computation.  Now, I 
need to write a test for the gradient subroutine.
This should be relatively easy.  Just create a simple
square grid and write some function and find the gradient
analytically, then compare with the results from the 
subroutine.  Then, I need to implement Venikanakrishnan's (?)
slope limiter.  After that, all I need to do is change the
update subroutine so that the fluxes from all the interfaces
are accounted for in the computation of the residual.  Then,
I need to implement boundary conditions.  I'm going to need
slip wall and farfield for now probably.  Then, the Euler 
solver should be done.
